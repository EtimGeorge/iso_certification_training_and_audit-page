## Notes

- All form submissions are currently handled by JavaScript for demonstration purposes. In a real implementation, you would need to add server-side processing for the forms.
- The theme toggle functionality uses localStorage to remember user preferences.
- Social media links currently point to the main websites and would need to be updated with your actual social media profiles.
